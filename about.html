                    <h2>Academic Journey</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am currently pursuing a dual major in Economics and Applied Mathematics at
                        Haverford College. My academic path has been shaped by a deep curiosity about
                        how economic systems function and how mathematical tools can provide insights
                        into complex social phenomena.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through my coursework, I have developed a strong foundation in microeconomic and
                        macroeconomic theory, econometrics, and advanced mathematical methods including
                        real analysis, linear algebra, and probability theory. This interdisciplinary
                        training allows me to approach economic questions with both theoretical rigor
                        and empirical precision.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <h2>What Motivates Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        My interest in economics stems from a fundamental question: how can we create
                        more equitable and prosperous societies? Growing up, I witnessed firsthand the
                        impact of economic policies on communities and became fascinated by the potential
                        of evidence-based research to inform better decision-making.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mathematics provides the language and tools to formalize economic intuitions and
                        test them rigorously. I am particularly drawn to the way quantitative methods can
                        reveal patterns in data, helping us understand causal relationships and evaluate
                        policy interventions. The combination of economic theory and mathematical precision
                        offers a powerful framework for addressing development challenges and inequality.

                <div class="content-block">
                    <h2>Long-term Goals</h2>
                    <p>
                        My goal is to pursue graduate studies in economics, specializing in development
                        economics and applied microeconomics. I aspire to contribute to academic research
                        that informs policy decisions and helps build more inclusive economic systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the long run, I envision working at the intersection of research and policy,
                        whether in academia, international organizations, or research institutions. I am
                        committed to producing work that bridges the gap between rigorous economic analysis
                        and practical solutions to real-world problems, particularly in developing countries
                        and emerging markets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond research, I am passionate about mentorship and education, and hope to
                        inspire others to pursue careers that combine analytical rigor with social impact.

                    <h3>Current Focus</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am actively seeking research opportunities in development economics and building
                        my technical skills in econometrics, data analysis, and computational methods.
                        I am particularly interested in projects related to poverty, inequality, education,
                        and labor markets in developing countries.
